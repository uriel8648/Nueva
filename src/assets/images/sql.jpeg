// This is a direct file copy operation from images/sql.jpeg to src/assets/images/sql.jpeg
// No code conversion is needed as this is an image file that should be copied to the assets directory
// The file appears to be a JPEG image of SQL-related content

// In an actual Angular migration, we would:
// 1. Create the target directory if it doesn't exist (src/assets/images/)
// 2. Copy the binary image file without modification
// 3. Update any references to this image in the codebase to use the new path

// For image assets, we simply need to ensure they're properly copied to the assets folder
// and that any references to them in the application are updated to use the Angular assets path.

// Example usage in Angular component:
// <img src="assets/images/sql.jpeg" alt="SQL illustration">

// No TypeScript conversion is needed for this binary image file.
