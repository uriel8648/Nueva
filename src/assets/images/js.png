// No code conversion needed for this PNG image file
// This is a binary file that should be copied from images/js.png to src/assets/images/js.png
// During the migration process, you should:
// 1. Create the directory structure src/assets/images/ if it doesn't exist
// 2. Copy the file using the file system:
//    - For Node.js: fs.copyFileSync('images/js.png', 'src/assets/images/js.png')
//    - Or use your OS file manager to copy the file manually
// 3. Update any references to this image in your application to use the new path
