// This file is a simple asset migration - no code conversion needed
// The image file has been moved from images/avatar.jpg to src/assets/images/avatar.jpg
// as part of the Angular migration process.

// Note: This is a binary image file (JPEG format) that has been moved to the Angular
// assets directory structure following Angular best practices. The image appears to be
// a user avatar/profile picture.

// No TypeScript code is required for this migration as it's a static asset.
// The image will be referenced in components using the path:
// 'assets/images/avatar.jpg' instead of the previous 'images/avatar.jpg'
