// This is a simple file migration - moving an image asset from the source to the target location
// No code conversion is needed as this is a JPEG image file that just needs to be copied to the assets directory

// Note: In a real migration scenario, you would physically copy this JPEG file from 
// images/html.jpeg to src/assets/images/html.jpeg without modifying the binary content.

// For Angular applications, static assets like images should be placed in the assets folder
// which is configured in the angular.json file to be copied to the output directory during build.

// No TypeScript code is required for this migration step as it's just a file copy operation.
