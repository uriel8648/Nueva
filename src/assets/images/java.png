This is an image file (PNG) that needs to be moved from `images/java.png` to `src/assets/images/java.png`. There's no AngularJS code to convert here - it's a binary image file that needs to be copied to the new location in the Angular project structure.

For image assets, you simply need to:

1. Create the directory structure `src/assets/images/` if it doesn't exist
2. Copy the image file from `images/java.png` to `src/assets/images/java.png`

No TypeScript code is needed for this migration task. The image will be accessible in your Angular application at the path `/assets/images/java.png`.
